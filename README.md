# Welcome to **[Little Learner's Lab Logs](https://little-learners-lab-logs.herokuapp.com/)**

## PERSPECTIVE
The main inspiration behind creating this website is a little curious learner, my little boy. When he started missing his normal visits to playgrounds during the winter break, he was on a constant lookout for activities around the house. Being among the large percentage of parents who wish to keep their kids engaged throughout the day, I started the quest of finding simple small fun activities that can be performed with the items available in the house. To find those activities, the best source is kids websites. Then followed a thought, what if one can perform the fun experiments and also can log the observations for others to read and repeat.. <br>
With this idea, I created "Little Learner's Lab Logs" which started for a little learner and after its creation, I see that it appeals to all the little scientists hidden within us. The user of this website could be a little kid referring to these logs for fun or a student who wishes to learn and create logs of their own. Not to mention it's a great place for parents, who can help their kids learn new concepts along with having fun. And for teachers, this could be a site where their students can enter their observations and understand the scientific methodology better. <br>
The aim is to collect simple fun-filled small experiments for the Learners created by the Learners.

# User Experience (UX)

## Site Goals
- Little Learner's Lab Logs is a website mainly meant for curious kids of all ages, where they can explore, create activity logs and also post fun science experiments that could even be performed at home. 
- It is also an useful site for busy parents, who wish that their children to learn new scientific concepts through simple fun experiments. 
- It is also a place for those passionate teachers who want to encourage their students to be motivated to learn science and be intuitive about the scientific concepts around them. 
- All users who sign up and sign in, can access all the features of the website and can create, edit, and delete their posts.

## User Personas 

# Agile Methodology
All functionality and development of this project will be managed through GitHub issues and projects. The initial conception was done using google sheets.
