# Welcome to **[Little Learner's Lab Logs](https://little-learners-lab-logs.herokuapp.com/)**

## PERSPECTIVE
The main inspiration behind creating this website was the curious little learner, my 3-year old son, missing his normal visits to the playgrounds during the winter break. Being among the large percentage of parents who wish to keep their kids busy throughout the day, I started the quest of finding simple small fun activities that can be performed with the items available in the house. To find those activities, the best option is always at your fingertips with kids websites easily accessible via phone/laptop. Then followed a thought, what if one can perform the fun experiments and also can log the observations for others to read and repeat. 
With this idea on my mind, I created "Little Learner's Lab Logs" which is for all the little scientists hidden within us. The user could be a little kid/student/parent/teacher who reads these lab logs to a student who aspire to enter experimental logs like a scientist. The idea is to collect simple fun-filled small experiments performed by the Learners for the Learners who have turned their backyards into science labs.

# User Experience (UX)

## Site Goals
- Little Learner's Lab Logs is a website mainly meant for curious kids of all ages, where they can explore, create activity logs and also post fun science experiments that could even be performed at home. 
- It is also an useful site for busy parents, who wish that their children to learn new scientific concepts through simple fun experiments. 
- It is also a place for those passionate teachers who want to encourage their students to be motivated to learn science and be intuitive about the scientific concepts around them. All users who sign up and sign in, can access all the features of the website and can create, edit, and delete their posts.
